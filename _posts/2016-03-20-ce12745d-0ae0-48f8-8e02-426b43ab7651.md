This is Bully, a  Patterdale Terrier.  He was bred from hunting lines and has an incredible amount of drive.  He's the first high-drive dog I've owned.  It is certainly not without its challenges but I love his attitude.  If he wants something, he will never quit trying to get it.

Here he caught a little bunny that found its way into our backyard.  He wouldn't drop it for anything.  I had to hold onto his collar just to get this picture because he kept wanting to run away - afraid I would steal his prize.
